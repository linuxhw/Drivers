# Drivers
The collection of files to help find drivers for devices:

* kernel   — LKDDb results for the Linux kernel
* nvidia   — NVIDIA Accelerated Linux Graphics Driver READMEs
* wl       — Broadcom Linux hybrid wireless driver READMEs
* sane     — SANE: Supported Devices
* fglrx    — Supported ASIC IDs for AMD GPUs
* hsfmodem — Linux drivers for the Conexant HSF Softmodem family

The LKDDb results are extracted with the help of tools from https://cateee.net/lkddb/. Others are taken from upstream without modification.
